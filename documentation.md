Environment Name 
-----------------------------
Environment names are ascertained one of two ways. in order of precedence:
* explicitely set via the command line
* explicitely in the config section of the enivronment cfg
* implicitely via the variable name

Sourcing sprinter configs
-------------------------
Sprinter configs can be sourced either via:
* online at a url with a sprinter config
* offline on a disk locally
This is differentiated on the command line with a 'http(s):' located at the beginning.
