* Add validator
* Catch exceptions failsafe
* check if environment exists before removing, throw message if it doesn't.
* ssh key to stash (probably covered by command)
* perforce (probably custom)
* add reconfigure command to re-choose values
* add switch
* add ability to source recipes dynamically
* refactor manifest. very messy right now.
